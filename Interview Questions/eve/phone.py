# Let's say we have a graph of tasks to run:

# 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8
#      |         ^
#      v         |
                #v
# 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7

# Where each task is identified by a single, unique number.

# We would like to run tasks in an "appropriate" sequential order, with the requirement that a task's dependencies should run before the task itself.

# Here are a couple appropriate orders for the example graph above:
# - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# - 2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 5, 8

# Implement an algorithm to output the tasks in any appropriate sequential order. You may design the input shape for the graph however you see fit.

# Now, let's assume each task has the ability to output a single integer value. We would like to implement the ability to conditionally execute tasks based on the output.

# 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 8
#      |         ^
#      v         |
# 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7

# Hereâ€™s an example:
# If output of node 3 is 0, traverse the 3->4 edge.
# Otherwise, traverse the 3->5 edge.

# What would the output task list look like if
# - only the 3->4 edge was traversed?
# - only the 3->5 edge was traversed?

# Design an interface that can capture the requirements of the conditional behavior, and adapt your algorithm accordingly.



# indegree 0 -> 1,2
# 4 -> 0
# 5 -> 0
# queue []
# res [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
