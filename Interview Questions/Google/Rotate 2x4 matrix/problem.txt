Given 2x4 matrix it contains numbers in the range 1-8.
For eg :
[4,2,6,5
1,8,7,3]

You have 3 operations:

Rotate : Middle 4 numbers rotate in clockwise manner.
[4,2,6,5
1,8,7,3]
becomes
[4,8,2,5
1,7,6,3]
Swap : swaps the two arrays
[4,2,6,5
1,8,7,3]
becomes
[1,8,7,3
4,2,6,5]
Shift (right):
[4,2,6,5
1,8,7,3]
becomes
[5,4,2,6,
3,1,8,7]
Your goal is to reach following state and return how many minimum operations would it take to reach that state.
[1,2,3,4
5,6,7,8]
