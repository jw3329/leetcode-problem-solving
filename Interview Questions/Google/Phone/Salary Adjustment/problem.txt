Give an array of salaries. The total salary has a budget. At the beginning, the total salary of employees is larger than the budget. It is required to find the number k, and reduce all the salaries larger than k to k, such that the total salary is exactly equal to the budget.

Example 1:

Input: salaries = [100, 300, 200, 400], budget = 800
Output: 250
Explanation: k should be 250, so the total salary after the reduction 100 + 250 + 200 + 250 is exactly equal to 800.
You can assume that solution always exists.
