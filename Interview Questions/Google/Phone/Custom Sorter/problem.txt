Implement a method that sort words, but instead of using the normal alphabet a, b, c, ..., x, y, z, we have ch that goes between h and i in the sort order. So the alphabet becomes a, b, ... h, ch, i, ... x, y, z.

Example 1:

Inout: ["indigo", "charisma", "hotel"]
Output: ["hotel", "charisma", "indigo"]
